# train-schedule

This is a simulation of a train schedule. Trains coming from multiple locations will be arriving at the Beckwith station throughout the day. The train board displays the name of the train, where it is coming from, how often it arrives, when the next train is due to arrive and how many minutes until the arrival.
The times are updated every minute, when the minute on the computer changes.
Feel free to add more trains to the schedule!
